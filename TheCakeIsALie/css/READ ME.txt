The Game database should have the following:
***************************************************

ID INT IDENTITY(1,1)
Title VARCHAR (eg: Battlefields)
Type VARCHAR  (eg: Strategy)
Description VARCHAR
Rating INT (1-5)
Price MONEY
Quantity INT
Trailer VARCHAR (css/images/trailer.mp4)
Image VARCHAR (css/image/battlefield.png) -- > This you will find in the images folder
Special INT (1 indicates it is on special and 0 indicates it is not on special)
Status INT (1 means the products active, 0 means the products been "deleted" by the admin
Comments INT (5)
User_ID INT FK

So user will have the 1 and the game will have the many

The user database should have the following:
***************************************************
ID INT IDENTITY(1,1)
UserName VARCHAR
Password VARCHAR
Password2 VARCHAR
Email VARCHAR
Address VARCHAR
Cellphone VARCHAR

The Game pricing database should have the following:
**********************************************************

ID INT IDENTITY(1,1)
Special INT (IF 1 it is on special, if 0 not on special)
Price MONEY 
Discounted_Price MONEY
Product_ID FK

So the product pricing will have the 1 and the product pricing will have the many

Then we will need a database for shopping cart:
************************************************

ID INT (This is the user ID)
Product_ID INT
Quantity INT

Then we will need a database for invoice:
************************************************
ID INT (This is the user ID)
Product_ID INT
Quantity INT
FK to products so that the quantity can be changed

//These are suggestions of how it should be set up. Feel free to ask me anything or to change the databases
